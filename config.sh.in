#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The "target_IP_address" variable specifies the IP address or hostname
# of the target. The deploy script transmits the files to the target using scp.
# The "target_username" variable specifies the user name, which is used by
# scp when the files are transmitted. In general, it is not necessary to change
# these values unless the network settings and/or the user name was changed on
# the target.
# The "target_application_folder" variable specifies the location on the
# target, where the application will be copied to by scp.
